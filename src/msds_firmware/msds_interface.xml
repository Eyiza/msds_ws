<!--
  ROS2 Plugin XML file for MSDS Firmware.
  ROS2 Plugins are used to define the interfaces and classes that can be loaded dynamically at runtime.
  Instead of hardcoding what hardware to use, we define them here and load them using the pluginlib library.
  This allows for more flexibility and modularity in the code.
  It will be used by the controller manager to load the hardware interface.
